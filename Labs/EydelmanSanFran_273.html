    SanFrancisco: the best and the worst
    </h1>
    
    <h2>
    The best neighborhood is the Tenderloin
    </h2>
    
    <p>I love filthy alleys, sketchy people and unsuspecting <strong>European victims</strong></p>
    
    <h2>The worst neighborhood is The Mission</h2>
    
    <p>I hate <em>pretentious artists</em>. local tourists and people with too much money. </p>
